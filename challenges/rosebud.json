        "full": "Some say that there was a cheat code for the original Sims that involved typing the phrase 'rosebud' followed by some number of exclamation points, followed by a 1. The cheat code would give one thousand credits for each exclamation point. Write a function that, when passed a string, returns the number of credits that the Sims would be rewarded with."
