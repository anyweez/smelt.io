        "full": "Heatmaps are used for displaying intensities (crime rates, for example) as colors, often in a grid. One of the more important calculations in a heatmap is how a particular value translates into a color.\n\nWrite a function that returns an object with a `red`, `green`, and `blue` property that range from 0 - 255. The function should accept a single number (1-100) as an input. The higher the number, the more red there should be. The lower the number, the more blue there should be. There should always be no green."
