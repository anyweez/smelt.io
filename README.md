Web site and serverside content for [sor](https://github.com/anyweez/sor) client. Sor is a community project and accepts challenge contributions from outside contributors. Approved challenges will be immediately available to all `sor` users.

## Process for challenge approval

Challenges should be designed as practice problems; there's no specific target difficulty. Sor maintainers reserve the right to reject any proposal, but use the following guidelines to ensure you're creating something great for the community.

1. Provide a concise title, description, and sample. Provide a variety of test cases that run using [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava).
2. Your description should be as concise and clear as possible.

If you want to submit a challenge, you should submit a pull request (or issue if you have an idea but no code). Challenges consist of a JSON definition file and a JS test file. Every challenge must have both of these files.
